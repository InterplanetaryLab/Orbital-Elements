# Orbital-Elements

This repositiory holds the MATLAB script which calculates orbital elements when given a position and velcoity vector. 

This is useful when needing orbital elements for radio link budgets or other programs for orbital trajectory. 

# How the code works

It is commented well, but it begins by using a MATLAB given function: ijk2keplerian. 
From here, the code is mostly calcualtions from a basic orbital mechanics class (AEE462 - Arizona State University) which offers more common obrital 
elements the given function doesn't solve for. 

For more information, I recommend reading Orbital Mechanics by Prussing & Conway

Happy Orbiting!
